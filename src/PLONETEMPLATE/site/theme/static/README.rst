Using grunt and bower
=====================

http://gruntjs.com/getting-started

if not already there, do::

    $ sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
    $ sudo npm install -g bower


locally install the rest::

    $ npm install


locally install bower::

    $ bower install


to get not development repositories but distributable shim repos, we can use
github.com/components.
for bower, "jquery" is dev, "jquery" is shim, "handlebars.js" is dev,
"handlebars" is shim.
